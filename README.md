## 🌟 Project Highlights

### 1. 🧠 Artificial Neural Networks (ANN)
- Explore basic to advanced ANN architectures.  
- Tasks include classification and regression.  
- Example: Predicting house prices, digit recognition.  

### 2. 🖼️ Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN)
- CNNs for image classification, object detection, and feature extraction.  
- Understand convolution, pooling, and feature extraction.  
- Example: CIFAR-10, MNIST classification.  

### 3. 🔁 Recurrent Neural Networks (RNN)
- RNNs and variants (SimpleRNN, GRU, LSTM) for sequence prediction.  
- Applications: Time series forecasting, NLP, sentiment analysis.  


### 4. 📊 Multi-Output Models
- Models predicting more than one target simultaneously.  
- Example: Age & gender prediction from images.  



## ⚡ Transformers & Attention (NEW)

Transformers revolutionized NLP and now dominate many AI tasks.  
They replace RNNs by using **self-attention**, allowing models to learn relationships between tokens in parallel.

### 🔑 Key Concepts
- **Self-Attention**: Each token attends to all others  
- **Multi-Head Attention**: Multiple attention heads capture richer features  
- **Positional Encoding**: Adds sequence order information  
- **Encoder / Decoder Architecture**:  
  - Encoder → representation tasks  
  - Decoder → autoregressive generation  

Transformers handle long-range dependencies extremely well and enable massive parallelism.  
They are used in NLP, vision (ViT), speech, and multimodal models.

## 🤖 GPT (Generative Pretrained Transformer)

GPT is a **decoder-only** transformer trained via **next-token prediction**.

### Features
- Autoregressive (left-to-right generation)  
- Causal masking  
- Excellent at text generation, conversation, reasoning, summarization  
- Scales extremely well with large datasets and model sizes

## 🧠 BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

BERT is an **encoder-only** transformer trained using **masked language modeling (MLM)**.

### Features
- Deep bidirectional understanding  
- Great for classification, QA, NER, embeddings  
- Learns context from both left & right of a token  
- Often fine-tuned for downstream tasks
